# Non Technical Lightning Talk

Coding is wonderful, but one of the best parts about any group of people, even coders, is how many different skills and interests they have.

For this assignment, you will give a **2 minutes presentation** on the topic of your choosing.  Let your passions and experiences be your guide.  Talk about what you love!

## Requirements

The requirements are fairly open, all that we are asking is that you...

- Limit your presentation to 2 minutes
- Don't assume your audience has any prior knowledge
- Have fun!

Please send your topic choices to @zeb on Slack by Sunday, so we can put together a presentation order.
